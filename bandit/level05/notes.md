# Searching multiple files / Bash Scripting

This problem involves automating tedious work
in this particular case, we can either use
- bash scripting
- special characters
- manual filtering

to solve this problem

There's another special character for the bash terminal
that helps address multiple files at once.

Matter of fact, these special characters are often called
regular expressions (regex)

regex is very powerful and useful for filtering down data and
creating parsers.

## A very nice explanation

## Solution
- Just do "cat *"
        This will print all files at once, you can manually check
        for the key
