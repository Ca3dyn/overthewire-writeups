# This challenge involves understanding hidden files
A hidden file in Linux (and in Windows) is a file that is intended to be invisible when listing files in the directory. 
This is useful for when storing configuration files that would otherwise be annoying to keep elsewhere
The names for hidden files are usually prefixed with a dot "." to indicate that it is hidden

We can address hidden files by using "ls" and "-a" flag to list all files including hidden ones
