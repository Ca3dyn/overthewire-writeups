Caeser cipher involves shifting all text by a certain amount of letters to the right or left
this is one of the most basic types of "encryptions" that has been used during the age of rome

You have the option to use a caeser cipher tool online, or you can use the following
"tr" command to shift each letter by 13 units

tr a-zA-Z n-za-mN-ZA-M {filename}

not expected to learn the exact syntax since it's pretty annoyingly specific
but just know that anything can be done in the terminal !
