# The diff command - text manipulation commands

This challenge requries you to find a line that is different among two files stashed in the home directory

All you have to do is just use diff!

There are many more utility programs stashed within the command line that provides a lot of 
convenience when manipulating text around.

```
man uniq
man fold
man sort
man grep
```
Here are some good ones for the next challenges ;)
